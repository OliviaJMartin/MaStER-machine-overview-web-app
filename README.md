This project is a Django web application that displays and stores the current status of each radiotherapy machine. This project is made for Lincoln county Hospital's radiotherapy department, who will use it for their three Linac machines, one CT and one Brachytherapy. 

The current system is paper records kept in a folder. This project will digitalize this process and store the data in a database. 

To run:
- Clone the project into a local folder.
- Open a command terminal and cd into the local folder
- run the command: py manage.py runserver 
- In the web browser, navigate to the local host, http://127.0.0.1:8000/

The database is on the internal server: IT034122\SQLEXPRESS
